# Marathon Runners EDA  

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a marathon runners dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The analysis explores participants' demographics, performance metrics, and trends in marathon events using Seaborn for data visualization.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from the marathon dataset. By analyzing the data, we aim to answer questions about runners' performance, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for event organizers or enthusiasts.  

## Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Exploratory analysis of runners' age, gender, and performance statistics.  
- Visualizations using Seaborn to highlight trends and correlations.  
- Key findings to improve marathon event planning.
